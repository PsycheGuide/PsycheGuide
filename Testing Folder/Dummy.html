        <mark style="background-color: blue;"> [Verse 1: Gawr Gura]</mark>
        Some "once upon a time" is not where our myth belongs
        Through the faded lines of words and rhyme is a hidden song
        Though fractured deeply worn by sorrows from time and time again
        Take my hand and enter our "pretend"
        
        <i>[Instrumental Break]</i>
        
        <mark style="background-color: orange;"> [Refrain: Takanashi Kiara] </mark>
        By star-lit skies, endlessly writing
        Inviting those along
        Lost souls who hear our song when gone astray
        Though strife's part of life, stay unafraid, now
        When forces say "behave"
        We say instead, "Be brave"
    
        <b>[Chorus: All]</b>
        In a desperate shout, our souls reach out
        With pen toward every page
        We ignite, come alive like a starry night
        With a fire no doubts can take away
        Got no fairy tale where "love prevails
        Though painful, now we move endlessly on
        By the light, your spark
        Head first, into the dark
        
        <mark style="background-color: pink;"> [Verse 2: Mori Calliope]</mark>
        Some "once upon a time" is not where a voice gets heard
        Will the faded lines of speeding time make us flightless birds?
        When pen is running dry, a soul on fire is driven to react
        And when burning flames attack, we will never fade to black
        
        <mark style="background-color: yellow;"> 2: Amelia Watson]</mark>
        Though fake, it seems, not a dream or a trick of light
        Always vacancy, take a seat, it's our story's time
        A world is brought to life, through voices five
        And as "real" as they say
        Pen as sword, we're choosing fate
        We can never lose our way
        
        <mark style="background-color: violet;"> [Refrain: Ina'nis Ninomae]</mark>
        By star-lit skies, endlessly writing
        Inviting those along
        Lost souls who hear our song when gone astray
        Though strife's part of life, stay unafraid, now
        When forces say "behave"
        We say instead, "Be brave"
        
        <i>[Instrumental Break]</i>
        
        <b>[Bridge: Mori Calliope, Takanashi Kiara, Ina'nis Ninomae, Gawr Gura & Amelia Watson]</b>
        Defiant 'til the end, I'll stay killing to sin
        I'll dance in burning embers unyielding
        Your love's given me wings
        While learning to remember the good times we bring
        Our ocean's finally full of life
        *Set every vital piece in motion, now we write*
        
        
        <b>[Chorus: All]</b>
        In a desperate shout, our souls reach out
        With pen toward every page
        We ignite, come alive like a starry night
        With a fire no doubts can take away
        Write a fairy tale where "love prevails"
        Cliched, maybe, we move joyfully on
        By the light, your spark
        Hopeless days are just a part of being free
        We wrote it all by heart
        
        <mark style="background-color: pink;"> Mori Calliope]</mark>
        And smile, side by side among the stars
